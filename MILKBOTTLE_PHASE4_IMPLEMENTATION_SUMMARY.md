from milkbottle.preview_system import get_preview_system

preview_system = get_preview_system()
success = preview_system.interactive_preview_workflow(pdf_path)
```

### 2. Configuration Wizards

**File**: `src/milkbottle/wizards.py`

**Features**:

- Guided setup for complex configurations
- Step-by-step configuration process
- Validation and error checking
- Configuration export to files
- Support for all major modules

**Available Wizards**:

- **PDFmilkerWizard**: 6-step configuration for PDF extraction
- **VenvMilkerWizard**: 4-step configuration for virtual environments
- **FontMilkerWizard**: 3-step configuration for font extraction

**Key Components**:

- `ConfigurationWizard` base class with common functionality
- Progress tracking and validation
- Rich interactive interfaces
- Configuration persistence

**Usage**:

```python
from milkbottle.wizards import run_wizard

config = run_wizard("pdfmilker")
```

### 3. Enhanced Main CLI Integration

**File**: `src/milkbottle/milk_bottle.py`

**New Menu Options**:

- Option 7: Interactive preview
- Option 8: Configuration wizards

**Features**:

- Seamless integration with existing menu system
- File type detection and appropriate preview handling
- Error handling and user feedback
- Consistent user experience

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure Adherence

All new features follow the established file structure:

```
src/milkbottle/
├── preview_system.py      # Interactive preview system
├── wizards.py            # Configuration wizards
├── milk_bottle.py        # Enhanced main CLI
└── modules/              # Existing bottle modules
    ├── pdfmilker/
    ├── venvmilker/
    └── fontmilker/
```

### Coding Standards

**Type Hints**: All functions include comprehensive type hints

```python
def preview_pdf_extraction(
    self,
    pdf_path: Path,
    output_dir: Optional[Path] = None
) -> PreviewResult:
```

**Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly messages

```python
try:
    # Operation
    return result
except Exception as e:
    console.print(f"[red]Error during preview: {e}[/red]")
    return error_result
```

**Documentation**: Google-style docstrings for all public methods

```python
def interactive_preview_workflow(self, file_path: Path) -> bool:
    """Run interactive preview workflow.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to preview

    Returns:
        True if preview was successful, False otherwise
    """
```

### Integration Patterns

**Module Integration**: New features integrate seamlessly with existing modules

- Preview system uses existing extraction and quality assessment modules
- Wizards generate configurations compatible with existing systems
- Main CLI maintains backward compatibility

**Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing dependencies and system tools

- Fallback mechanisms for missing external tools
- Clear error messages with actionable suggestions
- Non-blocking operation when possible

## Testing Results

### CLI Integration Testing

- ✅ Main menu displays new options correctly
- ✅ Version command works with new imports
- ✅ Menu navigation functions properly
- ✅ Error handling works as expected

### Feature Testing

- ✅ Preview system imports and initializes correctly
- ✅ Configuration wizards start and display properly
- ✅ File structure validation works
- ✅ Integration with existing modules successful

### User Experience Testing

- ✅ Rich console output with proper formatting
- ✅ Interactive prompts work correctly
- ✅ Progress indicators display properly
- ✅ Error messages are clear and actionable

## Performance Considerations

### Preview System

- **Caching**: Preview results cached to avoid re-processing
- **Lazy Loading**: Preview content generated on-demand
- **Memory Management**: Configurable preview size limits
- **Timeout Handling**: Operations timeout to prevent hanging

### Configuration Wizards

- **Validation**: Real-time configuration validation
- **Persistence**: Configurations saved to files for reuse
- **Modularity**: Each wizard is independent and focused

## Security Features

### Input Validation

- File path validation and sanitization
- Configuration parameter validation
- Type checking for all user inputs

### Error Handling

- No sensitive information in error messages
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Secure configuration file handling

## Future Enhancements (Phase 4.1)

### Planned Features

1. **Export Options Menu**: Enhanced format selection with previews
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning-based quality assessment
3. **REST API Integration**: Complete the existing API server
4. **Enterprise Features**: User management and audit logging

### Technical Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**: Parallel processing for previews
2. **Caching Enhancement**: Persistent cache for preview results
3. **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration system
4. **Plugin Integration**: Wizard system for plugin configuration

## Code Quality Metrics

### Maintainability

- **Modular Design**: Each feature is self-contained
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs between components
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and comments
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout

### Testability

- **Unit Tests**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Mock Support**: Easy mocking of external dependencies
- **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive error handling testing

### Extensibility

- **Plugin Architecture**: Easy to add new wizards and preview types
- **Configuration System**: Flexible configuration management
- **Module Integration**: Simple to integrate with new modules
- **API Design**: Clean interfaces for future extensions

## Conclusion
